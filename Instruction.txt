The concept of the game is fairly simple. A player will try to catch as many fish as possible using a specific number of casts. Each item that is caught will either add points to the player's score or deduct points from the player's score.
Each cast will be simulated by rolling a single die. The side of the die that is up will represent what is caught. A value of:
•	1 represents a big fish and is worth 20 points
•	2 represents an old shoe and is worth -10 points
•	3 represents a goldfish and is worth 5 points
•	4 represents a fish and is worth 10 points
•	5 represents a toilet seat and is worth -20 points
•	6 represents a shark and is worth 40 points
